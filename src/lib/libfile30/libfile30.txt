  Library Philosophy and Basic use instructions
==========================================================================

	Following the philosophy that a programmer who wants to read, say,
the number of atoms and the irrep labels from file30 should not have to use
fifty lines of code to do so, libfile30 was written.  Following a call to a
single command, file30_init(), the programmer can extract many useful bits
of info from file30 relatively painlessly.  libfile30 is dependant upon
libipv1, and requires that the input parser be initialized so that the
proper filename labels may be referenced.  An example of a minimal code
which sets up the input parser, initilizes a special structure within the
file30 library, and reads the scf energy, eigenvector and eigenvalues is
given below.  In order to illustrate the writing capability of the library
routines, a dummy correlated energy is written to file30 and then read out
again within the code.

==========================================================================
  Sample Code
==========================================================================
#include <stdio.h>
#include "file30.h"
#include <libciomr.h>
#include <ip_libv1.h>

FILE *infile, *outfile;

void main(void)
{
 
  int nmo;

  double escf, ecorr;
  double *evals;
  double **scf;

/* initialize the input parser, read in the files information from the
** default section
*/
  ffile(&infile,"input.dat",2);
  ffile(&outfile,"output.dat",1);
  tstart(outfile);
  ip_set_uppercase(1);
  ip_initialize(infile,outfile);
  ip_cwk_clear();
  ip_cwk_add(":DEFAULT");

/* now initialize the file30 structure and begin reading info
*/
  file30_init();

  escf = file30_rd_escf();
  evals = file30_rd_evals();
  scf = file30_rd_scf();
  nmo = file30_rd_nmo();
 
  file30_wt_ecorr(-1000.0);
  
  ecorr = file30_rd_ecorr();

  file30_close();

/* print out info to see what has been read in.
*/

  fprintf(outfile,"\n\n\tEscf  = %20.10lf\n",escf);
  fprintf(outfile,"\tEcorr = %20.10lf\n",ecorr);
  fprintf(outfile,"SCF EIGENVECTOR\n");

  eivout(scf,evals,nmo,nmo,outfile); 
  
  tstop(outfile);
  ip_done();
 }

/* dont forget to add the obligitory gprgid section 
*/

char *gprgid()
{
   char *prgid = "TEST30";

   return(prgid);
}

  Routines for initializing and cleaning up file30 structures
==========================================================================
FILE30_INIT

int file30_init(); 
    
   Initializes the file30 struct to allow other file30_*
   functions to perform their duties.

 arguments: none, but it requires that the input parser be initialized
   so that it can open file30.

 returns: zero.  Perhaps this will change some day.

==========================================================================
FILE30_CLOSE

int file30_close(); 
       
   Closes up file30, frees file30 struct.

 arguments: none, but file30_init must already have been called for
   this to work.

 returns: zero.  Perhaps this, too, will change one day.

==========================================================================
  Routines to read information in from file30
==========================================================================
FILE30_RD_ANGSO_COEFF

double *file30_rd_angso_coeff():  Reads in the array of SO coefficients
        for every angular momentum present in the basis. The array is
        organized in blocks - SO coefficients for atom class 1, 2, etc. Every 
	block is organized in subblocks: s-subblock of length 1 (1 SO x 1 AO),
	then p-subblock (if p-functions are present in the basis) of length 9
	(3 SOs x 3 AOs, first 3 elements correspond to the first SO, pz,
	next 3 - to the second SO, px, and the last 3 to the 
	third SO, py), then d-subblock, etc. Ordering of SOs within each 
	particular block is according to symmetry.

     takes no arguments.
  
     returns: double *angso_coeff    a matrix of mx_angso_coeff doubles

==========================================================================
FILE30_RD_ANGSO_LABELS

int **file30_rd_angso_coeff():  Reads in the array of labels corresponding
     to the matrix of SO coefficients angso_coeff. Each label consists of 4 
     integers. The first integer denotes the type of AO (1 - s, 2 - px, 3 - py,
     4 - pz, 5 - dxx, 6 - dyy, 7 - dzz,  8 - dxy, 9 - dxz, 10 - dyz, 11 - fxxx,
     12 - fyyy etc.). The third and fourth integers are the symmetry block of the SO
     and the dimensionality of the irreducible representation. The
     second integer is the number of the first basis function of this type within the
     symmetry block. Since there might exist several basis functions that belong
     to this type withing the given class of atoms, those are taken into account 
     as well.

     example:  for cc-pVTZ 1A1 CH2 the beginning of angso_labels will look like
       angso_label[0]        1    1    1    1
       angso_label[1]        2    5    1    1
       angso_label[2]        3    5    1    1
       angso_label[3]        4    5    1    1
       angso_label[4]        2    1    3    1
       angso_label[5]        3    1    3    1
       angso_label[6]        4    1    3    1
       angso_label[7]        2    1    4    1
       angso_label[8]        3    1    4    1
       angso_label[9]        4    1    4    1
       The first line corresponds to the s-SO on C, it will be the first
       in the A1 block, but there're 3 more s-shells on C. The next 3 lines
       correspond to pz function on C, and it will be function # 5 in A1 block.
       Remember, the content of angso_labels or angso_coeff doesn't depend on
       whether pure angular momentum d- and f-functions are used or not.

      


     takes no arguments.
  
     returns: int **angso_labels    a matrix of mx_angso_coeff x 4 integers

==========================================================================
FILE30_RD_CCVECS

double **file30_rd_ccvecs():	 Reads in a matrix rows of which are 
	ALPHA (ccvecs[0]) and BETA (ccvecs[1]) matrices of coupling
	coefficients for open shells stored in lower triangular form.
	Coupling coefficients are defined NOT as in 
	C.C.J.Roothaan Rev. Mod. Phys. 32, 179 (1960) as it is stated in the
	manual pages for CSCF, but according to Pitzer (no reference yet)
	and are **different** from those in Yamaguchi, Osamura, Goddard, and
	Schaefer's book "Analytic Derivative Methods in Ab Initio Molecular
	Electronic Structure Theory".
	 The relationship between the Pitzer's and Yamaguchi's conventions is 
	as follows : ALPHA = 1-2*a , BETA = 1+4*b , where a and b are 
	alpha's and beta's for open shells 
	defined on pp. 69-70 of Dr. Yamaguchi's book.

  takes no arguments.

  returns:
	double **ccvecs	a matrix 2 by abs(IOPEN) rows of which are coupling
			coefficient matrices for open-shells in packed form.
			For definition of IOPEN see file30_rd_iopen().

==========================================================================
FILE30_RD_CLSDPI

int *file30_rd_clsdpi();

  takes no arguments.

  returns:
    int *cldpi  an array which has an element for each irrep of the
                point group of the molecule (n.b. not just the ones
                with a non-zero number of basis functions). Each element
                contains the number of closed shells for that irrep.

==========================================================================
FILE30_RD_CONTR

double *file30_rd_contr();
    Reads in the normalized contraction coefficients.

  takes no arguments.

  returns:  double *contr 
    Normalized contraction coefficients are returned as an array of doubles.
    In file30 they are stored as a matrix 5 by nprim (only 5 types of 
    angular momentum functions currently supported in PSI, namely s-, p- , 
    d-, f-, and g-), but each primitive Gaussian function contributes only
    to one shell (and to one basis function, of course), so most of the values
    stored in the file are zero and do not need to be returned.

==========================================================================
FILE30_RD_CORR_LAB

char *file30_rd_corr_lab(); 
    Reads in a label from file30 which should describe the
    wavefunction used to get the correlated energy which is stored in
    file30 (see rd_ecorr() description).

  takes no arguments.

  returns a char *corr_lab  which should be a string like "CISD", or
       "MCSCF" or some such wavefunction designation.

  N.B. The placement of the correlated energy in file30 is currently
    under discussion, and this function may disappear with little or
    no notice.

==========================================================================
FILE30_RD_ECORR

double file30_rd_ecorr():  
    
     Reads in the correlated energy stored in file30.

   takes no arguments.

   returns: double e_corr   the correlated energy.  To get some
     information (a label) on the type of correlated wavefunction
     used to get this energy, see rd_corr_lab().

  N.B. The placement of the correlated energy in file30 is currently
     under discussion, and this function may disappear with little or
     no notice.

==========================================================================
FILE30_RD_ENUC

double file30_rd_enuc();

double *file30_rd_evals();  
     
    Reads in the SCF eigenvalues: the SCF orbital energies.

  takes no arguments.

  returns: double *evals   an array of _all_ of the SCF eigenvalues,
    ordered by irrep, and by increasing energy within each irrep.
    (i.e. for sto water, the four a1 eigenvalues all come first, and
    those four are ordered from lowest energy to highest energy,
    followed by the single b1 eigenvalue, etc. --- Pitzer ordering)

==========================================================================
FILE30_RD_EXPS

double *file30_rd_exps();
    Reads in the exponents of the primitive Gaussian functions.

  takes no arguments.

  returns: double *exps   The exponents are returned as an array of doubles.

==========================================================================
FILE30_RD_GEOM

double **file30_rd_geom(); 
    Reads in the cartesian geometry from file30.

  takes no arguments.

  returns: double **geom   The cartesian geometry is returned as a matrix
    of doubles.  The row index is the atomic index, and the column is the
    cartesian direction index (x=0, y=1, z=2).  Therefore, geom[2][0]
    would be the x-coordinate of the third atom.

==========================================================================
FILE30_RD_HFSYM_LABS

char **file30_rd_hfsym_labs(): 
   
    Read in the symmetry labels _only_ for those irreps
    which have basis functions.

  takes no arguments.

  returns: char **hfsym_labs   an array of labels (strings) which denote
     the irreps which have basis functions (in Cotton ordering).  For DZ or
     STO water, for example, in C2v symmetry, this would be an array of
     three labels: "A1", "B1", and "B2".

==========================================================================
FILE30_RD_ICT

int **file30_rd_ict();  
    Reads the transformation properties of the nuclei
    under the operations allowed for the particular symmetry point group
    in which the molecule is considered.

  takes no arguments.

  returns: int **ict  a matrix of integers. Each row corresponds
    to a particular symmetry operation, while each column corresponds to
    a particular atom.  The value of ict[2][1], then, should be interpreted
    in the following manner: application of the third symmetry operation of 
    the relavant point group, the second atom is placed in the location
    originally occupied by the atom with the index ict[2][1].

==========================================================================
FILE30_RD_IOPEN

int file30_rd_iopen();  
  
  Reads in the dimensionality (up to a sign) of ALPHA and BETA vectors of 
  two-electron coupling coefficients for open shells. (see file30_rd_ccvecs())
  Note : IOPEN = MM * (MM + 1), where MM is the total number of
  irreps containing singly occupied orbitals.

  takes no arguments.

  returns: int iopen   the +/- dimensionality of ALPHA and BETA vectors of 
  coupling coefficients for open shells.

==========================================================================
FILE30_RD_IRR_LABS

char **file30_rd_irr_labs(); 
     Read in the symmetry labels for all irreps in the
     point group in which the molecule is considered.

  takes no arguments.

  returns: char **irr_labs   an array of labels (strings) which denote
     the irreps for the point group  in which the molecule is considered,
     _regardless_ of whether there exist any symmetry orbitals which
     transform as that irrep.

==========================================================================
FILE30_RD_IPC

int **file30_rd_ipc();
    Reads in the SO transformation information. Each row-vector equals
    I + ShellNumber*VecL*DimL, where I is just a row-vector of 1's, 
    ShellNumber is the number of index of a shell in the corresponding 
    subset of shells with the particular angular momentum 
    (e.g. if it's a first p-shell in the full list of shells on atoms of the given class,
    ShellNumber = 0, etc.), VecL is a row-vector each element of which is the
    number of basis functions arising from this type of shell that belong ot
    the particular irreducible representation and DimL is the largest element in VecL 

  example: 
    1) an atom on the z-axis (C2v symmetry):
    s-shell VecL=(1 0 0 0)
    p-shell VecL=(1 0 1 1)
    d-shell VecL=(3 1 1 1)
    f-shell VecL=(3 1 3 3)
    g-shell VecL=(6 3 3 3)
    2) an atom in the yz-plane (C2v symmetry):
    s-shell VecL=(1 0 0 1) (+ and - combinations)
    p-shell VecL=(2 1 1 2)
    etc.

  takes no arguments.

  returns: int **ipc  a matrix of nshell*nirreps integers.

==========================================================================
FILE30_RD_ISC

int **file30_rd_isc();
    Reads in the SO transformation matrix. Apparently, this feature was used
    when PSI was able to handle degenerate point groups. Now it seems like it 
    is just ********a matrix full of 1's********* It is not clear what the 
    content of the matrix is in reality

  takes no arguments.

  returns: int **isc  a matrix of nshell*nirreps integers.

==========================================================================

int file30_rd_mxcoef;  

   Reads the value of the constant mxcoef.

   orbitals for each irrep.  This gives the number of elements in the
   non-zero symmetry blocks of the SCF eigenvector.  For STO water
   mxcoef = (4*4) + (0*0) + (1*1) + (2*2) = 21.

==========================================================================

  returns: int nprim   total number of primitive Gaussian functions.

==========================================================================
FILE30_RD_NSHELL

int file30_rd_nshell();

    Reads in the total number of shells. For example, DZP basis set for 
    carbon atom (contraction scheme 9s/4s,5p/2p,1d/1d) has total 15 basis 
    functions, 15 primitives, and 7 shells. Shells of _all_ atoms are counted
    (not only of the symmetry independent; compare nprim).

  takes no arguments.

  returns: int nshell   total number of shells.

==========================================================================
FILE30_RD_NSYMHF

int file30_rd_nsymhf();

int *file30_rd_openpi();  

    Reads in the number of open shells per irrep.
    takes no arguments.

int *file30_rd_orbspi();  

    Reads in the number of symmetry orbitals in each irrep.

  takes no arguments.

==========================================================================
FILE30_RD_SCF

double **file30_rd_scf();  

    Reads in the SCF eigenvector (or whatever is stored in its place).

  takes no arguments.

  returns: double **scf_vector    This square matrix has dimentions nmo
    by nmo (see: rd_nmo()).  The symmetry blocks of the scf vector appear
    on the diagonal of this matrix.  So, for STO water, scf_vector would
    come out looking something like the following:

        *** *** *** *** 0.0 0.0 0.0
        *** *** *** *** 0.0 0.0 0.0
        *** *** *** *** 0.0 0.0 0.0

        0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 *** ***
        0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 *** ***

   where the *** represent the non-zero values, and the 0.0 entries
   represent (double)0.  The eigenvectors are stored with the column 
   index denoting mos and the row index denoting sos: this means that 
   scf_vector[i][j] is the contribution of the ith so to the jth mo.

==========================================================================
FILE30_RD_BLK_SCF

double **file30_rd_blk_scf(int irrep):  Reads in a symmetry block of 
	the SCF eigenvector (or whatever is stored in its place).

    rows.  The eigenvectors are stored with the column 
    index denoting mos and the row index denoting sos: this means that 
    scf_vector[i][j] is the contribution of the ith so to the jth mo.

==========================================================================
FILE30_RD_SHELL_TRANSM

int **file30_rd_shell_transm();

    that type of the shell. That array used for manipulation with
    indices in integral calculations.
      For s-type shells this index is 1(there exists only one possible
    s-type cartesian primitive Gaussian), for p-type - 4 (there are 3
    possible p-type primitives), for d-type - 10, for f-type - 20 ...
    This index exists thanks to the limit on the possible angular momentum
    of the basis functions. Hopefully, it will be changed soon.
    Note : smax(l) = smax(l-1) + (l+2)*(l+1)/2

  takes no arguments.

  returns: int *smax   The indices are returned as an array of integers.

    only one possible s-type cartesian primitive Gaussian), for d-type - 5
    (there are 3 possible p-type primitives), for f-type - 11 ... This
    index exists thanks to the limit on the possible angular momentum
    of the basis functions. Hopefully, it will be changed soon.
    Note : smin(l) = smin(l-1) + (l+1)*l/2

  routines to write information to file30
==========================================================================
FILE30_WT_CORR_LAB

void file30_wt_corr_lab(char *corr_lab); 
   
    Writes a label into file30 which should describe the
    wavefunction used to get the correlated energy to be stored in
    file30 (see wt_ecor() description).

  arguments: char *corr_lab  which should be a string like "CISD", or
       "MCSCF" or some such wavefunction designation.

  returns: nothing.

  N.B. The placement of the correlated energy in file30 is currently
       under discussion, and this function may disappear with little or
       no notice.

==========================================================================
FILE30_WT_ECORR

void file30_wt_ecorr(double ecorr);  
 
   Writes the correlated energy to file30.

   arguments: double ecorr   the correlated energy.  To write some
       information (a label) on the type of correlated wavefunction
       used to get this energy, see wt_corr_lab().

  N.B. The placement of the correlated energy in file30 is currently
       under discussion, and this function may disappear with little or
       no notice.

==========================================================================
FILE30_WT_ESCF

void file30_wt_escf(double escf); 

    Writes the scf energy to file30.

  arguments: double escf  the scf energy.

  returns nothing.


==========================================================================
FILE30_WT_EVALS

void file30_wt_evals(double *evals);

    Writes out the SCF eigenvalues: the SCF orbital energies.

  arguments: double *evals   an array of _all_ of the SCF eigenvalues,
      ordered by irrep, and by increasing energy within each irrep.
      (i.e. for sto water, the four a1 eigenvalues all come first, and
      those four are ordered from lowest energy to highest energy,
      followed by the single b1 eigenvalue, etc. --- Pitzer ordering)

  returns nothing

==========================================================================
FILE30_WT_IPC

void file30_WT_ipc(int **);
    Writes out the SO transformation information. Each row-vector equals
    I + ShellNumber*VecL*DimL, where I is just a row-vector of 1's, 
    ShellNumber is the number of index of a shell in the corresponding 
    subset of shells with the particular angular momentum 
    (e.g. if it's a first p-shell in the full list of shells on all atoms, 
    ShellNumber = 0, etc.), VecL is a row-vector each element of which is the
    number of basis functions arising from this type of shell that belong ot
    the particular irreducible representation (for s-shell in C2v symmetry
    VecL=(1 0 0 0), for p-shell VecL=(1 0 1 1), for d-shell VecL=(3 1 1 1),
    for f-shell VecL=(3 1 3 3), for g-shell VecL=(6 3 3 3), etc.), and DimL
    is the largest element in VecL (s - 1, p - 1, d - 3, f - 3, g - 6, etc.)

  arguments: int **ipc  a matrix of integers nshell by nirreps

  returns nothing

==========================================================================
FILE30_WT_ISC

void file30_wt_isc(int **);
    Writes out the SO transformation matrix. Apparently, this feature was used
    when PSI was able to handle degenerate point groups. Now it seems like it 
    is just ********a matrix full of 1's*********

  arguments: int **isc  a matrix of integers nshell by nirreps

  returns nothing

==========================================================================
FILE30_WT_SHELL_TRANSM

void file30_wt_shell_transm(int **);
    Writes out the transformation matrix for the shells. Each row of the 
    matrix is an orbit of the shell under symmetry operations of the point 
    group

  arguments: int **shell_transm  a matrix of nshell*nirreps integers.

  returns nothing

==========================================================================
FILE30_WT_SCF

void file30_wt_scf(double **scf_vector);    

    Writes a set of molecular orbitals in place of the SCF vector.

  arguments: double **scf_vector    This square matrix has dimentions nmo
    by nmo (see: rd_nmo()).  The symmetry blocks of the scf vector should
    appear on the diagonal of this matrix.  So, for STO water, scf_vector
    should look something like the following:

        *** *** *** *** 0.0 0.0 0.0
        *** *** *** *** 0.0 0.0 0.0
        *** *** *** *** 0.0 0.0 0.0
        *** *** *** *** 0.0 0.0 0.0
        0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 *** 0.0 0.0
        0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 *** ***
        0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 *** ***

    where the *** represent the non-zero values, and the 0.0 entries
    represent (double)0.  The eigenvectors should be stored with the 
    column index denoting mos and the row index denoting sos: this 
    means that scf_vector[i][j] is the contribution of the ith so to 
    the jth mo.

  returns: nothing.

==========================================================================
FILE30_WT_BLK_SCF

file30_wt_blk_scf(double **scf_vector, int irrep);

    Writes in the SCF eigenvector (or whatever is to be stored in its place).

  arguments:

    int irrep   the number of the irrep to which the symmetry block
        belongs (this includes irreps with orbspi[irrep] == 0)
        n.b. this routine assumes that the first irrep will have
        irrep == 0.

    double **scf_vector    This should be a single symmetry
       block of the SCF eigenvector.  Its dimension should be
       orbspi[irrep]*orbspi[irrep]; The eigenvectors should be stored 
       with the column index denoting mos and the row index denoting sos: 
       this means that scf_vector[i][j] is the contribution of the ith so 
       to the jth mo.

  returns: nothing.

==========================================================================
FILE30_WT_SHELL_TRANSM

void file30_wt_shell_transm(int **);
    Writes out the transformation matrix for the shells. Each row of the 
    matrix is an orbit of the shell under symmetry operations of the point 
    group

  arguments: int **shell_transm  a matrix of nshell*nirreps integers.

  returns nothing

  old fortran name : ISO

==========================================================================
FILE30_WT_ZVALS

void file30_wt_zvals();

        Writes in an array of nuclear charges.

 arguments:
	double *zvals	An array natom long which contains nuclear
			charges (as doubles). This function can
			be successfully used to provide asymmetric guess
			orbitals for SCF calculations. For example, if you
			want to perform an SCF calculation on a homonuclear
			diatomics (DXh) using CXv guess orbitals, you might
			want to do an SCF calculation on heteronuclear
			diatomic molecule with identical basis sets on BOTH
			atoms, and then use this function to set charges
			of nuclei back to equal in file30. But don't run
			inputth after this procedure :-)

 returns no arguments.
